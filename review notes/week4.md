# Lecture 4: HPC and MPI

#### Supercomputers
* 任何有**高处理力**的计算机系统
* Any single computer system that has exceptional processing power for its time.

#### High Performance Computing (HPC)
* 任何有**可以达到高性能的架构**的计算机系统
* Any computer system whose architecture allows for above average performance
* Clustered computing: two or more computers serve a single resource
    * Improve performance and provide redundancy
    * Typically a collection of smaller computers strapped together with a high-speed local network 
* Clustered HPC
    * More **efficient, economical, and scalable** method -> dominates supercomputing

#### Parallel and Research Programming
